This file describes the files in this assignment submission.

4 files were submitted for this assignment. 

The clean data, in "tidyData.txt", was uploaded as attachment in the course assignment page.

The remaining 3 files, README.md, CodeBook.md and run_analysis.R were uploaded to this Github repository.

CodeBook.md describes the raw data, the variables and outlined the transformations performed to clean up the raw data into the required form.

run_analysis.R is the R script used to perform the transformation. The script assumes all require data files are copied into the same folder as it. The script requires dplyr and reshape2 libraries.
